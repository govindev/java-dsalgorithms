Difference between Stable vs Unstable sorts

Take an example of array of elements {10, 8, 7, 8`, 5, 2}
Here 8 is repeating 
If after the sort array looks like {2, 5, 7, 8, 8`, 10} this is called as Stable sort
If after the sort array looks like {2, 5, 7, 8`, 8, 10} this is called as unstable sort; because 8` comes last in the 
unsorted array but comes first in the sorted array. 

It is always adviced to go for stable sort. Advantages can be observed when you have two different properties in an object
that goes for sorting


To make sure stable sort occures be careful with the comparision operation. Always do not use >= or <= signs, instead use
< or > when comparing the elements for the swap.
